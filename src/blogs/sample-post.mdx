## Code Snippet with Syntax Highlighting

Here's a code snippet demonstrating our syntax highlighting capabilities:

```javascript
// Example of a modern JavaScript function
const greetUser = async (name: string) => {
  try {
    const greeting = await fetchCustomGreeting(name);
    console.log(greeting);
    return greeting;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to greet user:', error);
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }
};

greetUser('World');
